# COVID-19_NSW_policy_suggestion-

Data3888 Project, aiming to provide policy suggest in regards to travel restriction. 

This report seek to examine the latest sitruation of COVID-19 in each country in order to give resoponce plan for New South Wales Government. It will first calculate the transmissibility(Confirmed cases Growth Rate), mortality, and then generate demongraphic data of each country from **World Bank DATA API** (Piburn.J,2018). Next I will investigate the correlation between Confirmed cases and Death with other factors. Use significant correlated factors, finding countries with similar condition as NSW and use their responce plan as reference. Based on Australia and NSW government policies, I will evaluate current measure as well as giving corresponding suggestions about future measure in NSW.
